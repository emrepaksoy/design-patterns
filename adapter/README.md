# Adapter pattern

In this example adapter pattern was used for conversion of two different electronic component details objects into final one.  
**Extension method which you can see on second screenshot** gives the client huge flexibility with using and creating new adapters.  
Current implementation is more professional, but if you look for simpler way, feel free to check **bonus folders** where  
you can see **two basic implementations of adapter design - simple way and partial class way**.
