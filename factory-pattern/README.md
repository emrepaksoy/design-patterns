# Factory pattern

In this example factory pattern was used to manage database access.  
As you can see, there are two implementations of DbFactory: *PostgreSQL* and *Mongodb*  
To test this example, you can run "**/user/latest**" endpoint and compare results after change of **Constants.CURRENT_DATABASE** variable
